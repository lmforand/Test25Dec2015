For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son that anyone who believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.  John 3:16

17For God did not send his Son into the world*[Jn 6:29,57; 10:36; 11:42; 17:8,21; 20:21] to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.* John 3:17
